# agentctl

A CLI tool for managing Claude Code configurations, hooks, and isolated workspaces using git worktrees.

## Features

- **Workspace Management**: Create isolated git worktree-based workspaces for parallel Claude Code sessions
- **Hook Integration**: Seamless integration with Claude Code lifecycle hooks
- **Auto-commit**: Automatic git commits on feature branches for Edit/Write operations
- **Context Injection**: Live git/workspace status injected into every Claude prompt
- **Notification System**: macOS notifications for Claude Code events

# Show version
agentctl version

# Initialize Claude Code configuration
agentctl init

# Create a new workspace
agentctl workspace create my-feature-branch

# List all workspaces
agentctl workspace list

# Show workspace details
agentctl workspace status my-feature-branch

agentctl workspace delete my-feature-branch
```

## Commands

### Workspace Commands

  - `--global` - Install to $HOME/.claude instead of current repository
  - `--force` - Overwrite existing files
  - `--no-index` - Skip Claude CLI repository indexing
